# Project Prompt: Adaptive, Machine Learning-Based DDoS Protection System for Cloud Infrastructure

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate a robust, multi-stage DDoS mitigation framework specifically for cloud environments. The system leverages a hybrid machine learning model to accurately detect both known and novel (zero-day) DDoS attacks in real-time. The goal is to create a scalable, cloud-native solution that can automatically analyze network traffic, identify threats with high precision, and trigger automated remediation actions to ensure service availability and security.

## Core System Architecture & Modules

The system is composed of three primary stages:

### Module 1: Real-time Traffic Monitoring and Feature Extraction

- Functionality: Ingests network traffic data from various sources (e.g., log files, real-time packet capture).
- Processing: Uses a data streaming pipeline to process high-velocity data.
- Feature Engineering: Extracts a comprehensive set of features, including flow-based, time-based statistical, and behavioral features to create a rich representation of the traffic for the ML models.

### Module 2: Hybrid Detection Engine

- Core Logic: Employs a dual-model approach for defense-in-depth.
- Component A (Supervised): XGBoost Classifier trained on CICDDoS2019 to identify known DDoS patterns.
- Component B (Unsupervised): LSTM Autoencoder trained on benign traffic to detect novel anomalies.
- Ensemble Logic: Combines the outputs of both models to make a final decision (Benign/Malicious) and trigger alerts.

### Module 3: Automated Remediation and Policy Enforcement

- Functionality: Receives alerts from the Detection Engine and executes automated responses.
- Actions: IP filtering, rate limiting, and alerting.

## Technical Stack

- Python 3.8+
- Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch) for LSTM Autoencoder
- Flask or FastAPI for API
- Docker for optional containerization

## Implementation Plan (high level)

1. Environment setup and data preparation (EDA, preprocessing, feature selection, SMOTE)
2. Model development and training (XGBoost + LSTM Autoencoder), save artifacts
3. Build detection pipeline and API, implement remediation scripts
4. Testing, evaluation, and deployment

Use this document as a blueprint for development, scoping, and iteration planning. For next steps I can: (A) wire this into the repo README, (B) add CI/test scaffolding, or (C) continue running runtime tests and building the API. Tell me which you'd like next.
